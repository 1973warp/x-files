# Most Credible Events

## Ranking the most credible

- **Number of Witnesses**: Represents the quantity of witnesses who observed the event. The higher the number, the more witnesses provide collective testimony.
- **Corroborating Evidence**: Indicates the presence and reliability of supporting evidence such as sensor data, videos, photos, official documents, eyewitness accounts, and testimonies. Higher values reflect stronger corroborating evidence.
- **Consistency**: Reflects the degree of consistency in the reported details and descriptions of the event across different witnesses and sources. Higher values indicate greater consistency.
- **Anomalous Behavior**: Evaluates the level of unusual or inexplicable behavior displayed by the UFO during the incident. Higher values suggest highly anomalous behavior.
- **Credible Witnesses**: Assesses the credibility and reliability of the witnesses involved, considering factors such as their professional background, reputation, and expertise. Higher values represent more credible witnesses.
- **Hoax Buffer**: Represents the potential motivation for a hoax or the likelihood of a deliberate fabrication. Negative values indicate a higher likelihood of a hoax.
- **Alt. Explanation Buffer**: Accounts for the availability of natural or prosaic explanations that could reasonably explain the observed phenomenon. Negative values suggest fewer plausible alternative explanations.
- **Total Score**: The sum of the individual scores for each category, providing an overall ranking for the incident based on the specified criteria.

1. **Nimitz Encounter**
The Nimitz Encounter refers to a series of UFO sightings by U.S. Navy personnel in 2004. The incident involved encounters with unidentified aerial objects exhibiting extraordinary flight capabilities. The high number of witnesses, including trained military personnel, contributes to its credibility. Corroborating evidence in the form of radar data, video footage, and pilot testimonies further supports the incident. The consistency of witness accounts and the anomalous behavior displayed by the UFOs during the encounters contribute to its high ranking. There is a low motivation for a hoax, and the possibility of a deliberate deception is unlikely, resulting in a minimal Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations. Overall, the incident receives a high Total Score.

2. **Phoenix Lights**
The Phoenix Lights incident occurred in 1997 when thousands of people reported witnessing a massive V-shaped object flying silently over Phoenix, Arizona. The incident involved a significant number of witnesses and multiple corroborating pieces of evidence, including video footage and photographs. The consistency of witness testimonies and the absence of a conventional explanation contribute to its high ranking. While the incident could be subject to a possible hoax, the motivation for such a large-scale deception is low, resulting in a relatively small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations. These factors contribute to its high Total Score.

3. **Rendlesham Forest**
The Rendlesham Forest incident occurred in 1980 when multiple U.S. Air Force personnel reported encountering a strange craft near RAF Woodbridge in England. The incident involved a high number of witnesses, including military personnel, and there is some corroborating evidence, such as radiation readings and witness sketches. The incident displays consistency in witness testimonies, contributing to its ranking. While some aspects of the incident can be explained naturally or prosaically, the overall anomalous behavior and the credible witnesses involved contribute to its high Total Score.

4. **Tehran UFO Incident**
The Tehran UFO Incident took place in 1976 when an unidentified object was detected on radar and visually observed by Iranian military jets near Tehran, Iran. The incident involved multiple witnesses, including trained pilots, and there is some corroborating evidence, such as radar data. The consistency of witness testimonies and the anomalous behavior of the object contribute to its high ranking. The motivation for a hoax is low, and the possibility of a deliberate deception is unlikely, resulting in a small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also relatively low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations.

5. **JAL Flight 1628**
JAL Flight 1628 refers to a UFO sighting by a Japanese Airlines cargo plane crew in 1986. The incident involved multiple witnesses, including the flight crew and air traffic controllers. There is some corroborating evidence, including radar data and witness testimonies. While the incident displays consistency in witness accounts and some anomalous behavior, the ranking is slightly lower due to a smaller number of witnesses compared to other incidents. The motivation for a hoax is low, resulting in a small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also relatively low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations.

6. **Belgian UFO Wave**
The Belgian UFO Wave refers to a series of UFO sightings that occurred in Belgium between 1989 and 1990. The incidents involved multiple witnesses, including police officers and military personnel. There is some corroborating evidence, including radar data and photographs. The incident receives a high ranking due to the high number of witnesses and consistent witness testimonies. The motivation for a hoax is relatively low, resulting in a small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also relatively low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations.

7. **Westall UFO Encounter**
The Westall UFO Encounter took place in 1966 when numerous students and teachers from Westall High School in Australia witnessed a UFO flying over their school grounds. The incident involved a significant number of witnesses and consistent witness testimonies. Although there is no direct corroborating evidence, the high number of witnesses and the absence of a conventional explanation contribute to its ranking. The motivation for a hoax is low, resulting in a small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also relatively low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations.

8. **Cash-Landrum Incident**
The Cash-Landrum Incident occurred in 1980 when Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Colby Landrum encountered a diamond-shaped object emitting flames near Huffman, Texas. The incident involved a small number of witnesses, but their accounts were consistent. While there is no direct corroborating evidence, the physical effects experienced by the witnesses and the absence of a conventional explanation contribute to its ranking. The motivation for a hoax is low, resulting in a small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also relatively low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations.

9. **Travis Walton Abduction**
The Travis Walton Abduction refers to an alleged abduction case that occurred in 1975 when Travis Walton disappeared for five days after encountering a UFO in Arizona. The incident involved multiple witnesses, including Walton's colleagues. While there is no direct corroborating evidence, the consistency in witness testimonies and the absence of a conventional explanation contribute to its ranking. The motivation for a hoax is relatively low, resulting in a small Hoax Buffer. The Alt. Explanation Buffer is also relatively low due to the lack of plausible prosaic explanations.

10. The Roswell UFO Incident, which took place in July 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico, is a highly debated and infamous event in UFO history. Numerous witnesses, including military personnel, reported witnessing the crash of an unidentified flying object (UFO) and the subsequent recovery of debris and bodies by the U.S. military. The incident receives a high ranking in various criteria: it has a significant number of witnesses, accounts of corroborating evidence, and consistency among testimonies. The anomalous behavior of the event adds to its credibility. However, the incident faces challenges in terms of limited concrete evidence, inconsistent official explanations, and the potential for motivations behind a hoax. Despite these factors, the Roswell UFO Incident holds a notable place in UFO lore and continues to captivate the interest of researchers and enthusiasts.
