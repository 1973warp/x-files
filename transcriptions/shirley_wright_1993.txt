all I recall is several people using the word Roswell and that must be where the crash occurs in and then they brought them to the other place it looked like an at an airport facility where there was like a rather good-sized building a hangar where they had the spaceship and that where they had the bodies was it an intact ship no no it was badly damaged was there anything written on the ship no not anything I saw no kidneys by the time I saw it can you describe what it looked like yeah did you touch these yeah they didn't let me do that but the other people were committed to do that because they were very curious about knowing what kind of materials they were the the body of the ship was uh the body of the ship was what I would call today rather a reflective material but when you looked at it and you were close to it it was rather dull so it had to be energy reflective or translucent or glowing and it was a disc shaped and it was not too high it was sort of concave you know how big was oh gee let me see it was uh I'm very bad at a large room and it was easily one-fourth the size of the room it was in were you able to go inside no I wanted to but the others did go inside yeah they went inside I was not permitted to do that not being one of the others I was just one of the Gophers you know going for this going for that you know I was nobody that was nobody but they went inside they also wanted to see the method of propulsion they were interested to see if they wanted to see if they had any other types of control devices or communication devices or what kind of even things they had for the journey in other words if they had come such a long distance how are they able to do that and so forth you know what you and I would call food or respiratory gases you know what did they use they were very interested in identifying that it looked like in some of them told me yes and it's it's very much oddly like a lot of science fiction movies today a lot of equipment very trim all along the perimeter things that would come up from the floor automatically pods that would come out things like that um can you tell us a little bit about the the beings and communicating pathic what kind of information was given did they ask you anything and did you ask them anything them several questions and they asked us several questions not myself individually or me particularly but the people I was people I was with uh they wanted to know they wanted to know how long we live they wanted to know if there were some conditions that terminated what we call quote unquote our life in other words what you and I would consider diseases or stresses on our body to terminate our life they asked let me see if I can remember [Music] I thought I'd never forget some of this I don't know why my mind is so blank on some of these things they asked a lot of the scientists uh what was their best system of going out into the atmosphere or going into the ocean and How Deeply we had penetrated galaxies things like that and of course they were very quick to let us know that we didn't know anything um they they did not Menace us or threaten us at all because they knew right away we were intellectually inferior and scientifically inferior then how was it that they crashed was there any information about that if they have such technology how is it that something had gone wrong and that was one of the major things that we asked them we asked them what they ate we asked them what kind of gases they needed we asked them about their life support their origin we asked them what they use for propulsion we asked them what there was things things like that and we asked them what they thought went wrong you know if and why they were first of all even coming here why did they come to visit us do you remember what they said obviously they're so obviously Superior why would they want to come to Earth what did they say well this one indicated at least telepathically like they I think it they don't have a sex like we do so I can't say here see or something uh it indicated that uh they were exploring intergalactic Galactic base what we would call Intergalactic space you didn't call it that uh search a better Source than where they were they were running into a problem where they are from because of some physical condition energy wise and they needed to go some other place and so we took it but they were wanting to maybe colonize some other place and they were finding that Earth was entirely unsuitable too and that's why they were because they found out that we are not at their level at all they had nothing to fear from us a little bit now [Music] but they still didn't know what happened to their propulsion system that would have brought them down well they didn't exactly know they knew that it was a malfunction of something but they they didn't know and in fact One Beat Just on the verge of trying to go with a couple engineers and scientists into it in more detail when he's succumbed it's a company and they couldn't drink in there were they only one ship or did they were they just a there by themselves as a scout ship for what were there any others in the Armada they claimed there were eight that was a Maverick that somehow lost physician or something I don't know what it was a Time Warp or what that they got out of the direction where the others were even going and one ship he claimed crashed in Siberia in the same group thanks of course he didn't know what it was called but we told them it's the United States did he say where they were from and what star system you said and were they from this galaxy they indicated to us that they were not from our galaxy definitely not from our galaxy and the uh star system name was absolute gibberish to us we didn't know was that at that point in time uh do you have any knowledge whether we found that star system now so far as I know we still have it unknown um what do and how many people were around when you were doing or were there government people were there other scientists and the people there were military people there were scientists there were lower Echelon people there were many individuals about about both men and women many people how did you get from where you were with the scientist you were with to that point of where the shipping military vehicles so to say um were you interrogated at all before they allowed you to see this no because I was just sort of in the background and I I was just you know I had no positive even fifth or sixth line interest in it or anything I was just a vegan assisting the scientists that I was with and part of his Entourage so to speak and that's why I was there and I was just permitted to be there how did you feel when you saw this and and saw what was taking place well I was quite overwhelmed and odd I I uh real or fantasy I wondered whether there was somebody playing a terrible [Music] untruth on us [Music] and it's just that the people there was such activity and be here and interest on a part of people I knew it was something serious but otherwise you'd think you were almost in part of some science fiction betrayal I mean you know some set or something did you have a security classification at that point in time or they just let you in without and kind of we all had the security clearance was that immediately before you went there or had you had one when you were working with uh okay [Music] and that secures security clearance was respected the only reason we could go is that's a craft or did they deactivate it after it was immediately deactivated in the other experiences you've had the other work you've done did you ever have any other kinds of security clearances I've never had a necessity since to have a security clearance no do you I've had a paper by the government on the ultimate structure of matter and National Academy of Science but I have had no security clearance do you remember what they call that clearance that you had did you have did they name it for you I don't even recall that except A5 I don't I don't I'd have to look that up I don't know whether I even have a note on that oh the program that you're working on with uh with Einstein was it funded by the government or was it a university grant grant to him at that University at that time to have outstanding students from around the country picked to work with him that particular summer in nuclear chemistry did you have a title that was given to you while you worked there special student did he take any other students with him no I was the only student lucky you come on I was his pet I have to admit that I was I was I have president that there were 29 and I had some Were You There When the only girl either when the the last alien crash died were you there at that point in time no I wasn't I was uh I was back at the motel in a city nearby and I had been told and I was pretty would be able to keep being alive how many were there originally nine I saw nine eight bodies and then later we communicated with that one so there were nine and can you describe they were oh I sure can I remember that very well they were a very light soft uh great I call it grayish green really and they had a slim lean uh they had no nose but they had markings where a nose opening would be they had eyes and a mouth no eyebrows they had ears they had a very forehead and I'd say relative to the rest of their body and the ones that I saw were approximately maybe uh five feet tall five feet five something that that they're small by what a mannered on Earth what did their eyes look like Their Eyes Were enormous they were very prominent they were the most obvious thing you'd see on their face were there any pupils I noticed but I never saw any pupils what color were they were almost uh brown black they were very very dark were they all the same color in terms of the oh yes did they have any kind of clothing on yes they had suits on what did they look like [Music] very much toward like what we call suits the only thing was though that I didn't recognize the fabric it didn't look like any fabric that I would know as a chemist or even today that I would recognize was there any kind of fastener what about their shoes their shoes were all looked like they were connected they were in one piece and their their hands their limbs were covered you know right down to what we would call the wrist what color was it and did it have was any kind of trim you mean the suit itself oh it had like an Insignia on it what what did the Insignia look like maybe I'd have to draw it for you it looks like uh not an artist but it looks like something like this I didn't know what it meant it's the Insignia the Insignia was almost in the middle the Garment it wasn't off on the side like we would expect to be did they need any special breathing apparatuses or were they did they appear to be breathing on their own and that was just amazing things that we were starting about where they could apparently survive in our atmosphere and they had apparently come such a long way did they seem to indicate that the atmos similar to our breathing they asked us about that and we asked them about it yes they seem to indicate yes that it was quite similar it was not identical to ours though because they claimed they had made tests did they tell you anything about because of their lifestyle was there we tried to find that out before we could they really we were very interested in not antagonizing them at all so to the point where we had them answer too many of ours so we never really found that out we just knew that they don't live all above ground according to what they told a lot of there's what we would call Subterranean did they seem repelled by our parents since they look so different oh they they thought we were very odd since you indicated that they were either androgynous or had no sex did they mention how they procreated that was another thing which we asked them about and we couldn't pin down either but no that they had just like we have at all did they tell you how they reproduce did they refuse or they just nobody broke them no they agree with that so they really were kind of limited in what they felt was appropriate to tell you I would say so yes I would say they were very careful what they revealed uh did it seemed like they wanted to have any kind of continual contact with this planet very definitely yes however they had already almost discounted this as a desirable place to come
