I've spent 10 years in Marine Corps four years working with the Air Force as a civilian doing experimental testing on aircraft since my Marine Corps days I was a pilot in the service and a fighter pilot and fought in World War II after late in the latter part of World War II and the Korean War conflict after I got out of the Marine Corps I took a job with the Air Force at Wright-Patterson do an experimental flight testing on various different modifications and Tech orders that they had Incorporated an aircraft various different aircraft f-89 back then the beef B-47 f-102 in those aircraft well I was at uh Wright-Patterson of course I was approached by a individual that and I I'm not going to mention his name to determine if I wanted to work in a an area and just new creative things okay and apparently that was the flying disc simulator what they had done they had selected several of us in a reassigned me to a link Aviation which was a simulator manufacturer at that time they were building what they call the c11b and f-102 simulator b47 simulator and so forth and they wanted us to get the experience before we actually started work on the flying disc simulator which I spent 30 some years working on the simulator wasn't actually functional until around 1958. where the simulator was actually operable craft that they used to build which is the 30 meter one was the one that the crashed and uh Arizona Kingman Arizona back in 53 or 52 I think it was 53. that's the one they used that's the first one that they took out to the test site uh it landed about 15 miles from which it used to be an Army Air Base uh which is now defunct army base I forget I can't recall the name of it but that particular craft there were some problems with number one getting it on the flatbed to take it up to area 51. they couldn't get it across the dam because of the road it had to be bars across the you know the Colorado River at the time and then taken up to uh where people go now up up 93 out the area 51 which was uh just being really constructed at the time and taken down those dirt roads and out out to that particular area of the test site there were four uh aliens aboard that thing and those aliens went to Los Alamos and they put certain people into their in there with them people that uh you know were astrophysicists you know just general scientists you know to ask them questions uh the funny the way the story was told to me was there was only one of them that would talk to any to to any of these scientists that they put in the lab with them only one of the aliens the rest wouldn't talk to anybody or you know even have a conversation with them you know first they thought you know it was all you know ESP or you know what do I want us what do I want to say uh telepathy yeah mental telepathy but you know most of that's that is kind of a joke to me because they actually speak uh maybe not like we do but they'd actually speak and can converse you know the difference between this aircraft and or this disc and other other discs that they had looked at was that it was much simpler design in the simulator it was one one big thing different the thing that like Lazar calls the reactor okay we didn't have a react we had a we had a space in a thing that looked like the reactor but that wasn't the thing we operated the simulator with we operated with six uh large capacitors that were charged with a million volts each says there were six million volts in those capacitors their largest capacitors ever built these particular capacitors they last for 30 minutes so you could get in there and actually work the controls and do what you had to to uh get the aircraft or get the simulator did this operate okay actually when it was operable it would lift off the ball about a certain amount of there was a dimension there that we had that had actually lifted up and it could actually turn you know a certain certain amount of degrees left to right or whatever in a simulator now uh you'll notice that uh there are no seat belts right uh and the same thing with the actual craft no seat belts you don't need seat belts because when you fly one of these things upside down there's no upside down like in a regular aircraft you just don't feel it uh you have your own gravitational feel right inside so if you're flying upside down to you you're right side up you're one ending Windows the only place we had any uh visibility at all and it was done with uh with cameras or videos type things at that time was in the turret in the turret section takes a lot of time because of the area and the smallness of it just to raise your hand it becomes complicated you have to be trained train with your mind you know to accept what you're going to actually feel and so there's some perceptual distortion there's a lot of distortion yeah seeing just moving about it's it's a after a while after you get used to it not only you and you do it it's it's it's simple you just you got to know where everything is you know and you got to understand what's going to happen to your body it's no different than you know accepting the g-forces you know when you're flying a aircraft that are coming out of a dive you know and that kind of thing it's a it's a whole new ball game did our flight Crews ever take one of these discs out into space you know I don't know that I don't I don't really know that I I just I'm sure they have uh I'm saying it probably took uh took a while to train enough of the people or sufficient time the whole big problem with this with the disc is that it's so exacting in its design and so forth and it can't be used say with uh it can't be used as a like we use aircraft today with uh dropping bombs and and you know having machine guns you know on the wings and that kind of stuff uh it's uh the design is so exacting that you can't add anything you can't it's got to be it's got to be just right there's a there's a big problem in the in the design uh of where things are put say you know that where the centered aircraft is and that type of thing even the fact that we raised it three feet so the taller guys could get in and stuff the actual ship was extended back to its original configuration but actually raised we had a long period of introduction into meetings you know say an EV e is an alien and I I call them j-rod of course that's what they call them but that wasn't his you know I don't know if that was his real name or not but that's the name that the the linguists gave him you know as a because so he knew J Rod you know and I I did draw a sketch of him when he was before I left him in a meeting but you know I I provided it to some people but that was my my impression of what I saw he'd sound just like if you spoke you sound like you you know he he's like one of the you know a parrot but but he 'd try and answer your question you know a lot of times you'd have a hard time understanding you know because if you didn't put it on paper and explain yourself half the time he couldn't give you a good a good question good answer well the preparation was uh you know basically uh going through first of all I went through all of the different nationalities in the world right just you know these whatever you know human nationalities yeah human nationality you know then they got into going into uh other forms of life you know even down to you know animals and that type of thing and the fact that uh you know this this this j-rod had his skin was pinkish but a little bit rough you know and that kind of stuff not you know not horrible looking you know or to me it didn't look horrible looking some of the guys you know that was in the particular groups that I was in they never even made it you know as far as I was concerned you know when they gave you the psychological question you know I just answered them the way I felt and I had no problem you know and that's what they wanted to know you know if you'd become uh like you know hey here's an alien he's he's from here and I don't know what you know one of those kind of things you know but it never bothered me you know it didn't didn't Mount to much so what kind do you know what kind of scientific advice he would give the the crew that was building or back engineering these basically it was the only engineering advice or science advice you know say for example I performed the calculation and there's a I spoke of a book that uh it's not a book it's a big assembly of various different divisions of uh on gravitational technology okay and uh the the key element in there all the information wasn't there because even our guys are people that were the top mathematicians and stuff couldn't figure some of this stuff out so we would take it and you know we'd have to with each design you know there's a requirement requirement for calculations and we'd have to prove by calculations you know that this thing's going to operate no different than anything else we do and sometimes you get into a spot where you try and try and try it even if you use the formulas to come up with this thing that they provide you it wouldn't work and that's where he'd come in you know the tell him to look at this and see what we did wrong the last 40 years or so or six years maybe there's a I'd say 40 Years anyway not counting the simulators I'm talking about actual craft is probably Maybe two or three dozen various different sizes that we've built or that we have that we built okay I don't know much about the ones that you know that they brought here I know about that one out of Kingman but that's about it and uh I know the company that hauled it out of there and who's out here now a couple different versions that they use one was a chemical version one was a solid version and I don't even know the chemistry of the chemical version but there's uh there's one with that operates with with other chemicals uh with certain chemicals actually what they've done with I think with these triangles that people have seen as they've got like two or three of say a 30 meter crafts that are in this in the center of it and the outside perimeter you know you could put anything you want as long as these particular ones are made to design criteria and they'll operate then it's more or less all that other stuff on the outside is tag along but I'm sure if they put a large weapon up there and fired it it would probably you know not work or they'd kill himself there's there are certain reasons for the secrecy I I could understand that no different than you know the first atomic bomb that they built but uh you know they're getting so far ahead now with aircraft design and people have come up and they're visualizing and seeing some of the design aspects that are put in some of the aircraft today and eventually I'm saying and like I told you got your gentleman earlier that 2003 most of this stuff will be out out in everybody's plate to look at maybe not the way that everybody expects it but in some manner they they determine appropriate you know that show everybody hey look at what we got so you'll be surprised you think this is the year 2000 that we're doing this interview so you think within three years that the public will be told I said this years ago 2003 and the reason why I said that the document I signed ends in 2003. and you're not the only one that signed and I'm not the only one see this uh this I call it fogator that's what they call it fundamentals of gravitational you know techniques techniques basically but it's a Vibe now I'm sure that manual now is this expanded or no different than anything else that they build for design criteria because anything we do today we have to have a design criteria manual you know and they put all the information in that and if you ever get one of these volumes of this these documents you'd be a be on top of the world get out of service I worked for the government you know as a test pilot a various different particular aircraft while I did that particular activity the I was asked if I would mind working on some simulators and I thought that was a good idea good for my future so I did we uh we were then reassigned it was just not myself there were several other fellas like myself engineers that were reassigned to certain companies here in the United States on the various different simulators that were that they were making for the various new aircrafts that they were building for example you know the f-89 f94 and f-102 in a group of others we spent uh probably close to three and a half four years just in training on simulators and uh just exactly you know how a similar an actual Simulator for these aircrafts work you know and the new designs that came along after they thought that we were trained sufficiently then we were asked to do another project which was more or less in my field as a mechanical design that was to uh join metal together without glue nuts you know or any of it he's just so forth you know for aircraft purposes to the indication was was to make the aircraft lighter okay this this course is uh several years going on in the meantime of course security classifications were going on you know as far as we were concerned and just the individuals that were going to work on these particular projects before going to the to the actual facility we're at done this activity we developed this particular process of joining this material it took quite some time over a period of about four years and then it was indicated to us that we'd go on a special project in New Mexico which we did and it was about three or four years after that we had gotten there that we found out that these were simulators for that we would be Engineers on simulators for flying discs there was one particular project they worked on associated with that disc was several years of course it's very time consuming in the translation of scientific data has provided to us by the Grays a specific type of Gray uh has this information was given to our scientists and various different Engineers that we had no association with but they were doing what they call a copy engineering the copy engineering was a process where they had taken an item or a part portion of the craft and they were disassembly of writing their procedures and identifying certain things as they took it apart and how it related to from their science to our science and could we use that I spoke in a little lecture here a while back that no average pilot could fly a flying just because it was so complicated and so foreign to the individual pilot that there would be no way that he'd be able to hop in one even if they gave it to him and said here fly this consequently what we did we took their avionics and transferred into our science and our technology and used avionics that we know of as far as aircraft is concerned uh the basic principles and all this as far as the Ava address was concerned was no different than a regular aircraft that we have if you understand that uh uh say for example a fighter a fighter aircraft it's it's much different than a flying disc and there were certain uh situations that we had to uh resolve and basically we only looked at a couple different things because the flying disc only flies in about three different positions and that is uh at 65 degrees a flat horizontal and possibly vertical but it was very difficult to fly vertical the avionics that we developed for that was for the 65 degrees pitching yaw and flat flight did you ever see this by yourself I saw this from a distance continuously not up close uh if I was describing a disc for you to so you'd understand what we're looking at if you did see the Bob Lazar poster uh very very similar this facility I was worked at is is I'd say as far as secrecy is concerned is much tighter than possibly even that was here and some of the other facilities you know in this country the the entrance and the locations and the scenario on on say hey guys you know here this is you know this is this is what this ship looks like okay that's what the ship looks like as far as entering the ship no but that was a disc how far away was it oh well I was say 10 or 15 feet away it was just sitting on the ground on his belly what did you feel in the moment and saw it what did you what was the impression of it I had my impression was as an engineer was just great have you ever seen any aliens we were introduced to Grays that were associated with the project but they were uh I could say that in a time that I spent maybe I'd seen the Grays half a dozen times or more but uh I have no more than 10 times I think but they were on uh the reason that we saw him was actually for us to get used to being associated with them okay it's no different than say going to Africa and seeing a bunch of big leaves and you know looking at those people for a while and then you know so it's this is a little different than that but it's the same same situation where you're seeing something that's a little bit different than us sitting in this room you know talking right now with their features in their makeup and that kind of thing
